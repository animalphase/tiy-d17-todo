#### Objectives
- Create a function that makes an AJAX request to the Etsy API using whatever search term you'd like.
- Create a data handler function to handle the data when it (asynchronously) returns from the API. Use this data to populate your webpage!
- Recreate the Etsy search results page, styled as closely as possible to the actual Etsy site..

#### Extra Objectives
- Allow the user to change the search term. When they make a new search, refetch the data and update the results list
- Pull the categories from the data to create the sidebar, with links that filter the listings.
- Implement the sorting dropdown.
